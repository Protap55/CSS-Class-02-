    <h1>Canada’s oil patch rattled by Trump's tariff threat</h1>
    <h2 class="heading2">In Canada’s oil-rich province of Alberta, there is a deep sense of unease over President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods.</h2>
    <p>Canadian politicians and energy experts are warning the hefty tariff would have dire consequences for the economy of America's northern neighbour - and hike prices on US consumers.</p>
    <div class="div1">
        <h4 class="heading3">"It has to find an accommodation with Trump."</h4>
        <h4 class="heading3">An increase in oil prices for US consumers would run counter to Trump's promise to slash energy costs.</h4>
        <h4 id="heading4">Around 40% of the crude that runs through US oil refineries is imported, and the vast majority of it comes from Canada.</h4>
